Description: Interface to 'Metaflow' <https://metaflow.org/>, a human-friendly 
  Python framework for building and managing real-life data science projects. 
  Originally developed at Netflix, Metaflow offers a unified API for data 
  science workflows, covering the full development lifecycle of a data science project.
  Key features include rapid prototyping, built-in versioning, horizontal and vertical scalability, 
  dependency management, and easy integration with production-grade orchestrators. The R interface 
  allows data scientists using R to leverage Metaflow's scalability and reproducibility while staying 
  within their preferred ecosystem.
